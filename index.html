		<p>If you do not know of all the absurd cruelties which are committed in your name, then allow me to tell you here that my words will be confirmed by any just person whom you may commission to investigate the matter. But once knowing that your name is used to justify the infliction of suffering upon the innocent and the best among the people, and that you are able to prevent it, you cannot have peace of mind until you have done this.</p>

		<p>In this war, the army will forever inscribe itself in world history as perhaps the most barbaric and inhuman army in the world. Purposefully killing civilians, destroying residential neighborhoods, civilian infrastructure, using all kinds of weapons for this.</p>

			It is not curses heaped on each gashed head?<br>
			Nor tears. Their blind eyes see not your tears flow.<br>
			Nor honour. It is easy to be dead.<br>
